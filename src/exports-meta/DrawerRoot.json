  "recommendations": [
    "Mount exactly one `DrawerRoot` near the top of the app tree (e.g. in the main layout) so `DrawerService` has a single target to render into.",
    "Use the `padding` prop to control the inner content padding of every drawer opened through `DrawerService` — defaults to `40px 48px`.",
    "Do not nest multiple `DrawerRoot` components; it subscribes to global pub-sub events and a second instance will receive the same open/close signals.",
    "`DrawerRoot` internally renders a `Drawer` with `variant: temporary`, providing backdrop and click-outside-to-close behaviour for all service-opened drawers.",
    "For drawers that need custom `variant`, `anchor` or `hideBackdrop`, pass those options as the second argument to `DrawerService.open(component, options)`.",
    "The root manages one drawer at a time; opening a new drawer while one is already open replaces the previous content — close the active drawer first if stacking is required."
